                        I begin this project by examining the entirety of the Data Science job market. <br/><br/>
                        The exploration of salary trends for Data Analysts between 2020 and 2024 highlights the predominance of mid-senior and senior roles, coupled with a nearly universal demand for full-time employment. <br/><br/>
                        The data as well suggests a clustering of job opportunities within medium to large-sized companies, where USD predominates as the primary currency for compensation.<br/><br/>
                        A more detailed examination reveals that Data Analyst positions are particularly coveted in the realm of Data Science - with their average salaries experiencing steady yearly increases, directly correlated with rising levels of experience.
